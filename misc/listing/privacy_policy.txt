Privacy Policy
Daniël Scholte built the GW2 Companion app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Daniël Scholte at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page is used for GW2 Companion users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
The GW2 Companion app does not gather any information about it's user.

Third Party
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.
The app uses the official Guild Wars 2 API (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main).
Please refer to the Privacy Policy of Arenanet (https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/arenanet-privacy-policy/).
Requests made to the Guild Wars 2 API require a token. The token needs to be entered by the user. The token will be stored on the phone, and won't be shared.

Cookies
This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app uses the official Guild Wars 2 API which might use cookies. Please refer to the Privacy Policy of Arenanet (https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/arenanet-privacy-policy/).

Permissions
The app uses the Camera permission to scan Qr Codes in form of tokens, generated by the Arenanet API. No data is collected using the camera. The use of the camera is not required, as tokens can also be entered manually.

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
